20200914 - 
I was using the MPRIS2 support patch from 
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pidgin-musictracker-mpris2/
for a long while without issues, though I started to notice after
a few days CPU usage of pidgin would creep up until it crashed, 
and eventually isolated this to the MPRIS2 support in musictracker.
I finally gave up searching for anyone else with the problem and dug
into the code.  I didn't find any reason where it could get stuck in any
kind of loop or what not and cause high CPU, but I did find that the
functions it used to talk to DBus were "outdated" and converted them
to the newer GDBus framework.  Of course, since I had to learn some new
style framework and I haven't seriously programmed in C since college
I expect there will be bugs.  In fact I'm sure already there's likely
a memory leak with some of the objects where I'm reusing pointer variables
without freeing them first, but I figured I'd throw this up now and watch
my pidgin memory usage later.  :) Hopefully it helps someone else!
